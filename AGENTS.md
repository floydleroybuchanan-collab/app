## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Product
CharmIPTV Phoenix — Expo/React Native Android TV guide + IPTV player (`frontend/`), with optional Cloudflare Worker (`cloudflare-backend/worker/`).

### Must-run services for local UI work
- `frontend/`: `npm ci` then `npx expo start --port 8081`
- API-backed runs: `cloudflare-backend/worker/` → `npx wrangler dev --port 8787 --local` (matches `EXPO_PUBLIC_CHARM_API_URL`)

### Non-obvious Guide / TV focus notes
- Drawer boots **closed**. Selecting **TV Guide** must hand focus into the Guide grid before drawer rows become `focusable={false}`; otherwise Android can strand focus on an invisible nav Pressable (chaotic D-pad, no visible focus ring).
- Preview rail **Drawer** button calls `openDrawer({ focusTop: true })` so focus lands on the first drawer row (Live TV), not the active route.
- Guide selection restore after a drawer/date/group transition goes through props on `<NativeGuideCanvas>` (`restoreChannelId`, `restoreTimeMs`, `reloadGeneration`), consumed natively by `NativeGuideView.restoreChannel`/`restoreTime`/`setReloadGeneration`. (Historical note: this used to be a JS-side `focusClaimNonce`/`focusGuideSurfaceWhenMounted` handoff against the retired TimelineGrid/BoxGrid renderer — that mechanism no longer exists.)
- Shell may claim Guide focus only when `navigate()` route is `/guide` (not when leaving Guide).
- The reclaim effect must **not** depend on `channels` identity (use `channelsRef`).
- D-pad page jump window is **300ms** rapid succession only. Second taps during brief FlashList focus flicker must still feed the detector (`recentlyOwned` grace).

### Guide cache / memory caveats
- Conveyor keep set is the expanded hysteresis band (`expandRunwayKeepSet` / `lastKeepIdsRef`), not the raw runway alone.
- Blur / memory-pressure release must use `pickKeepIdsAroundFocus` around `lastChannelId` — never `source.slice(0, keepLimit)` on an ascending keep list (drops the focused neighborhood).
- `loadGuide` must **soft**-trim the programme window cache so silent refresh cannot wipe hysteresis; strict retain belongs to `retainProgrammeWindowCache`.
- `clearGuideCache()` must also call `clearGuidePrograms()` or Settings “Clear guide cache” leaves stale JS programme rows.
- Power profile changes the symmetric runway size: Compatibility (`weak`) uses 5 pages each way; Normal 8/8; Max preview 10/10.
- Reuse `buildChannelIndexMap` across viewport buckets — do not rebuild the id→index Map on every half-page focus move.
- On Guide refocus, rewarm from `lastRunwayRef` before the first D-pad event.
- The native Guide's painted-row cache (`NativeGuideView.programs`, filled by `scheduleQueryDrain`) is capped at `PAINT_CACHE_CHANNELS` (128, or `LOW_RAM_PAINT_CACHE_CHANNELS` 64 under memory pressure) — this replaced the old JS-side TimelineGrid `previousPreparedByKeyRef` prune rule when the retired JS grid was replaced by the native Canvas renderer. Keep it bounded the same way if this cache is ever restructured.
- Pending EPG Pressable may stay mounted for focus stability, but once real cells exist it must use `pendingProgramCellHidden` (1×1 / opacity 0) so it cannot paint over programme cells.
- Blur / critical memory pressure must `retainGuidePrograms(keep, { force: true })` / critical trim so subscribed off-keep rows empty to `EMPTY_PROGRAMS`.
- Stable Media3 fullscreen buffer is capped at **32MB** (TiViMate Large class; not 72MB) to reduce Fire TV OOM with guide preview + player.
- Guide preview freezes Media3/VLC compat remount keys while the Guide route is unfocused (Tabs keep-alive) so Settings toggles do not remount a background decoder.
- Auto-retry must not remount while `circuit-open` / `isFullscreenCircuitOpen`; call `clearStreamFailure` on successful `playing`.
- More-groups and PIN overlays need `FocusGuide` traps (same as ProgramModal). Guide title block stays `pointerEvents="none"`.

### Settings locations
- **Appearance**: Instant Guide / reduce motion, density, group layout, preview mute/hide
- **Player**: buffer profiles (low latency / balanced / stable), preferred audio language, silent-audio fallback, Media3 + VLC knobs, subtitles
- **Health**: match/failure counts plus last audio diagnostics snapshot

### Standard commands
See `frontend/package.json` for `lint`, `test`, `typecheck`, and Expo scripts. Prefer those over inventing new ones.
